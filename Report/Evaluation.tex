\section{Evaluation}
The group has experienced some problems related to working together as a team. In the beginning the amount of work placed into the project varied vastly from one group member to another. The group sat down and discussed the matter, and after that discussion most of the group worked good and more evenly together. One of the helping factors was that the group decided to meet up from 15:30 to 21:00 each Monday and Wednesday to work together. This time was agreed upon as one of the group members was fully occupied with his day job during the days.

Even though the group as a whole improved a lot after the above mentioned discussion, one group member has seen limited improvements. This rest of the group tried to help him improve by assigning him small and manageable tasks with clear deadlines, and offering to help if it was needed. Regardless of this, the group saw very limited improvements, and at the end of the project he disappeared for a week without notice or answering any of the groups attempts to contact him. The group member was reported to the course staff as the group was not successful in improving his participation.

In the beginning of the project, the group divided the roles between themselves. This was done in an arbitrary fashion. As a result of this, the group member with the least participation, was appointed project leader. At some point before the middle of the project, the secretary stepped up and assumed the project leader role as well by lazy consensus, due to the responsibilities of the project leader not being taken care of. In retrospect it is clear that the roles should either be assigned in a more thought through fashion, or the group should have been more active as a whole in ensuring that each member assigned to a role fulfilled the responsibilities of it.

The group early on decided that approaching the project with SCRUM was desirable. In theory this was good choice as the system was not conceptually finished by the customer, so changes was anticipated. In practice the group had a hard time adjusting to thinking in an agile way, which in turn led to some extra work and frustration as the group at first worked in a waterfall fashion within SCRUM. The group also suffered from a feeling of lack of time because the group was reduced, and as such focused more on meeting the wishes from the customer, and the methodology and the documents suffered from this. As a result, real testing, apart from the functional testing done by the programmers while implementing functionality, was not done before the end of the project. Because of this the testing part of the project is not really following SCRUM. Looking back, the group should have spent more time in the beginning of the project discussing what using SCRUM would actually mean for this particular project. In this discussion someone with extensive experience in handling projects with SCRUM should have been included if possible.

The project task was more open ended then the group had expected, and substantially more time than planned was needed to figure out what the system should actually be and how it should work. That being said, it has been very interesting and educational to be part of the whole process and working with the customers that are very experienced in their fields.

Communication with the customer was mostly unproblematic, particularly because weekly meetings were held between the group and the customer. This was helpful in catching problems relatively early on. Some problems did surface, however. It became clear that the personalities of the customer and one of the group members did not go well together. This did lead to some heated discussions, that could have been avoided if the group had become aware of this matter earlier. This serves to show the group the importance of being able to identify different personalities and invoke the required actions to mitigate potential problems that might arise.

During the weekly meeting with the advisor the group received valuable feedback on how to handle the work and the documentation. The advisor was also helpful in reading through the report multiple times during the project. All suggestions made by the advisor was implemented and helped the group writing a better report as well as giving a better insight in how a professional report should be written and structured.

The system developed was a prototype and it would require quite some effort to take it from the stage of prototype into production. First, the technical problems outlined in chapter~8 in the report would need to be handled in a satisfactory manner. Second, the usability of adding new content to the system would need to be improved in order to ease adoption.

In addition the what's been mentioned above, the group has experienced the difficulty of having multiple parties to satisfy. While the course is mostly focused on the report, only some chapters are of direct interest to the customer, who is mostly interested in a working prototype with accompanying documentation.

The group did not manage to accomplish all the goals we wanted to, but a fully functional prototype was produced as well as quite substantial documentation. The group would have liked to accomplish more of the goals that were set, but due to what has been mentioned above, this was not possible.

Regardless of some problems, the course has been interesting and very educational on multiple levels. Not so much on a technical level, but very much so on group dynamics, report writing, customer interaction, psychology and project administration.
